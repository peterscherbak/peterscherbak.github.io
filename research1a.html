<h3>
  A movie of the equatorial plane of four of the MT simulations I performed, 
  for decreasing MT rate (10<sup>-1</sup> M&odot;/yr, 10<sup>-2</sup> M&odot;/yr, 
  10<sup>-3</sup> M&odot;/yr, 10<sup>-5</sup> M&odot;/yr). 
  Mass is initialized in an envelope atop the donor's core. 
  As time progresses, mass flows toward the companion M2, located a distance 
  <i>a</i> from the donor. Also labeled are two Lagrange points, L2 and L3. 
  Time is in units such that 2&pi; corresponds to one orbit.

  I performed hydrodynamic simulations of binary mass transfer (MT) incorporating 
  radiative cooling of the gas. This probes a broader range of MT rates than the 
  previous simulations (<a href="research1.html">here</a>), which assumed the gas 
  was adiabatic and were most valid at very high MT rates (&gt;10<sup>-2</sup> M&odot;/yr). 
  In the simulations, mass flows from the donor into an accretion disk, with significant 
  equatorially-concentrated outflows through the outer Lagrange point L2 occurring 
  for MT rates ≳10<sup>-3</sup> M&odot;/yr, while the MT remains mostly conservative 
  for lower MT rates. In all cases, any outflowing gas approximately carries the specific 
  angular momentum of L2. The gas cooling luminosity <i>L</i> and temperature increase 
  with MT rate, with <i>L</i> ∼ 10<sup>5</sup> L&odot; and <i>T</i> ∼ 10<sup>4</sup> K 
  for simulations featuring the strongest outflows, with contributions from both the 
  accretion disk and circumbinary outflow. Although the most luminous transients 
  associated with mass outflows will be rare due to the high MT rate requirement, 
  they will generate significant optical emission from both the accretor's disk 
  and the circumbinary outflow.
