## Research Interests
My work focuses on **binary star systems, white dwarfs, and transients**, with particular interest in **mass transfer, tidal physics, and the role of common envelope evolution in stellar astrophysics**. I use **theoretical models and computational simulations** to study the evolution of compact binary systems.‚Äù
